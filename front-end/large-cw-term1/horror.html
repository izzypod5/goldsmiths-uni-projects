<div><h1>Horror</h1></div>
 <p>Ever since I was a kid I have always loved horror movies. 
 If a new horror film gets released whether it has cheesy jump scares or it's one of the old classics, I'm likely to go and give it a watch.
 I enjoy being scared with the thrill of an unexpected event as I put myself in their situation.
 One of my all time favourite films I have watched would have to be Pan's Labyrinth. 
 I liked the background of it being during the World War II period, it comes with a great fairy tale like story but of course the real horror
 comes from the monster also known as "The Pale Man".
 I can't help but recall shouting at the tv "Don't do it!" thinking how silly the little girl was being as she was warned not to partake of the fruit
 by the fairys but proceeded to do so anyway.</p>
