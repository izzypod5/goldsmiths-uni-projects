	Since joining Goldsmiths University I have joined both the anime society and a running group.

	I have liked anime for a couple of years mainly because I appreciate the artistic work that goes into it, the plot and that they have many genres to choose from. 
	Personally my favourite genres are horror/psychological/adventure.
	I have probably met the most people from this society and we always go on weekly events whether its going to the pub just for a meetup, watching anime screenings or outside events.
	Some events I have been on include: cinema screenings, ice skating at <a href="http://hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/" target="_blank">Winter Wonderland (Hyde Park)</a>,
	visit to China town and <a href="http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/" target="_blank">MCM London Comic Con</a>.

	<h2>Running

	</h2>
	I enjoy running with my group as it has enabled me to get to know other people outside of my personal circles or in my year. 
	I liked to at least think about my fitness a little especially since I do spend a lot of time around computers and its great to get a change of scenery and to get a breath of fresh air.

	<h2>Hacksmiths

	</h2>
	Hacksmiths is the technology related society I occasionally go to this if there is an interesting topic relating to my field of interest. One of the last events I went to involved github
	and how to version our work which was very helpful.
