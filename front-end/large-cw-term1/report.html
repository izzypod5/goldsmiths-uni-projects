<h1>Adam Letch Report: Large Coursework Option 1</h1>

<p><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</strong> These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</p>

<p>I didn't really take a lot of inspiration from others. I just thought that making a website as my own personal portfolio could be very beneficial to my future. For the content I like the design of linkedin which I probably took inspiration from.</p>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong></p>

<p>My website is accessible as I provide alternatives for auditory and visual content, provide ways to help users navigate and find content and I ensure my website is easily readable and understandable. </p>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong></p>

<p>My site is responsive to different devices, it offers a clear simple design and lastly is relevant to the user's needs.</p>

<p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</strong> (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>

<p>Although I knew about Angular JS I hadn't previously used it much so there was a bit of a catch up to get it up and running. I also learnt about bootstrap more along with css styling design.</p>

<p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</strong></p>

<p>I specially liked the custom events use since it was an idea I had come up with from the very start when I thought about making a portfolio along with the use of modals and the gallery of pictures. The reason I liked this was because it allowed for animation to be used and other techniques with events I could use in the future.</p>

<p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe try to not use bootstrap next time and have a more hands on approach with the design aspect of the site given I have more time.</p>

<p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work?</strong> You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</p>
