<div><h1>Gaming</h1></div>

<p>In my spare time I occasionally do gaming. 
My first inspiration was from a text based MMORPG game called "Torn" which inspired me to create my own version of the game using PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL and Javascript.
The aspects of the game I think stood out was its many unique features, it was relatively simple design, it is very community based with its IRC, factions, forums, 
messaging system and community events, it has a mafia sort of theme and you can learn a bit from trading, stocks and companies.
I have always been a fan of handheld devices from the old Game Boys with the original Pokemon games being one of my favourite first games.
As for console games I had a vast collection of Playstation games one of my favourite being "Bomberman Party Edition" and it had one of the most best intros and music in my opinion.
One of my most played games on the PC which I still play a lot now is "League of Legends"(A multiplayer online battle arena). 
It is a free game which I appreciate and is very popular as most of my friends also play it which makes it more enjoyable. 
One of the best factors to the game is that it is forever evolving from different patches that get applied so you sort of need to readapt to the game and find all the
new strengths and weaknesses as well as in game changes which affect gameplay. 
It is also strategic as it revolves around teamplay and how you make use of advantages, plays and moving around the map.</p>
